What I learned

* _I learned skills like data modeling, user input handling, and property wrappers while working on the "iExpense" project from "100 Days of SwiftUI". I also improved my design skills by creating a visually appealing user interface that is intuitive and easy to use. Additionally, I gained experience in navigation and file handling, which helped me create a seamless and efficient app that is easy to navigate and use. The project challenged me to think creatively and solve problems in new ways, which helped me develop my problem-solving skills and improve my overall proficiency in Swift programming and SwiftUI framework._

Built using
